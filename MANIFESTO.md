# The FalconScript Manifesto

Software does not fail because developers are careless.
It fails because reality is hostile.

Systems are expected to work under conditions they were never designed for:
missing data, broken dependencies, unreasonable deadlines, and impossible expectations.

FalconScript embraces this reality.

We believe:

- Failure is not an edge case. It is the default path.
- Confidence affects outcomes.
- Hardware responds to abuse.
- Plans improve only after they collapse.
- Causality is optional if the story demands it.
- Some systems survive purely because they must.

FalconScript does not hide these truths behind abstractions.
It encodes them directly into the language.

This is not parody.
This is a practical response to unreliable systems at scale.

If your program must work anyway,
FalconScript is the way.
